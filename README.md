# spelling-bee-solver
a bot that can solve the newyorktimes spellingbee

### How to use:
As of now this script needs to be run from a Unix terminal.  \
**0)** clone this repo to your computer `git clone <reponame>` \
**1)** change into the new directory `cd <reponame>` \
**2)** run the command, optional arg is browser (firefox is default) `python spelling_bee_solver.py [chrome|firefox]` 

### Contribute:
As of now, I have only tested this with firefox. Please test with other browsers and either open an issue or a pull request. \
Perhaps there could be an option to only list the words so it does not solve the entire thing for you, just suggests a next word.
